# template.yaml for Authorization and Authentication Reference Architecture

metadata:
  name: Authorization and Authentication
  description: |
    This reference architecture provides a robust and scalable solution for implementing 
    OAuth 2.0 and JWT-based authorization and authentication. It is designed to ensure
    secure identity management, access control, and API protection for microservices 
    and web applications. Integration with Identity Providers (IdP) and Multi-Factor 
    Authentication (MFA) is supported.

repository_template:
  description: |
    This repository contains the bootstrap code and configurations needed to set up 
    OAuth 2.0, JWT, and an Identity Provider for managing user authentication and 
    access control.
  components:
    - Authentication Server: |
        This component handles OAuth 2.0 authorization and issues JWT tokens.
        It integrates with the Identity Provider (Keycloak, Auth0, etc.) for user authentication.
        It is configurable for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support.
    - Resource Server: |
        The resource server is responsible for validating JWT tokens and enforcing
        role-based or scope-based access control on protected API endpoints.
    - Client: |
        Sample client code for web or mobile applications to request tokens from 
        the authentication server and access protected APIs.
  repository_structure:
    - /bootstrap: Initial code to set up authentication and authorization flows.
    - /config: Configuration files for OAuth, JWT, and the Identity Provider.
    - /ci-cd: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated builds 
      and deployments.
    - /docs: Documentation with detailed setup instructions, best practices, 
      and tutorials.
    - /examples: Sample client and API code for integration.

documentation:
  overview: |
    This reference architecture enables secure authentication and authorization 
    through OAuth 2.0 and JWT. It integrates with Identity Providers (IdP) like Keycloak 
    or Auth0 to handle user credentials and provides a clear path to implement role-based 
    access control (RBAC).
  tutorial: |
    Follow the step-by-step guide in the documentation to set up OAuth 2.0, configure
    an Identity Provider, and secure your APIs. The tutorial covers initial setup, token 
    issuance, validation, and enforcement of security policies.

  decision_records: |
    Decision records document the rationale for selecting OAuth 2.0, JWT, and 
    specific Identity Provider integrations. These records explain the trade-offs 
    considered and the best practices adopted in the architecture.

deployment_manifest:
  infrastructure_requirements: |
    This architecture requires a Kubernetes cluster for deployment, with Helm charts 
    available to configure OAuth services and the Identity Provider.
    Optional: Use cloud-native services such as AWS Cognito or Azure AD for identity management.
  components:
    - OAuth2 Authorization Server
    - JWT Token Validator
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for APIs
    - Identity Provider (Keycloak, Auth0, etc.)
  storage: "Requires a database for user management (Postgres, MySQL, or external service like AWS RDS)."
  compute: |
    Resource requirements for running the Authorization Server and Resource Server 
    (1 vCPU, 512MB RAM minimum).

monitoring:
  description: |
    This template includes Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for monitoring
    authentication and authorization flows.
  alerts: |
    Configure alerts for token issuance failures, high login errors, or unusual activity 
    to ensure the system remains secure.
