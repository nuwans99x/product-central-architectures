# Authorization and Authentication Reference Architecture

This repository provides a reference architecture for implementing Authorization and Authentication systems using React.js for the client-side and .NET for the server-side. This architecture serves as a guideline for developers to implement secure and efficient authentication and authorization mechanisms in their applications.

## Overview

The architecture includes two main components:

- **Client**: Built with React.js, handling user authentication and authorization workflows.
- **Server**: Built with .NET, managing the authentication logic, user data, and authorization processes.

## Structure

- **client/**: Contains the React.js application for user authentication and authorization.
- **server/**: Contains the .NET backend for handling authentication and authorization logic.

## Getting Started

To get started, refer to the individual README files in the client and server directories for setup instructions and usage details.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this architecture by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or suggesting enhancements.
